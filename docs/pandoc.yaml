abstract: |
  This paper presents L.I.F.E THEORY (Learning Individually from Experience), a novel self-evolving neural architecture that demonstrates fully autonomous intelligence through closed-loop learning, self-organization, and continuous optimization. The system achieves state-of-the-art latency (1.75 ms mean; 57× faster than clinical SOTA) with competitive accuracy (79.9%) and complete CI/CD automation, producing an auditable evidence trail suitable for clinical and regulatory review.
